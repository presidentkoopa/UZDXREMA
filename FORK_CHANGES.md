# DoomXR fork — engine changes

Everything this fork adds on top of upstream, in one place, so another
engine developer can see what was touched and why without reading the log.

Branch: `doomxr`. Each area below is self-contained; nothing here depends on
anything else here.

| Area | What it is | Detail doc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Billboards](#1-billboards) | oriented world quads with hit testing — an in-world UI primitive | [`BILLBOARDS.md`](BILLBOARDS.md) |
| [Surface glow](#2-surface-glow) | floors and ceilings glow on their own face; wall glow gains shape | — |
| [Sweep](#3-sweep) | world-space bands of light that wrap every surface | — |
| [Volumetric beam](#4-volumetric-beam) | a raymarched light cone with dust in the air | — |
| [Bloom](#5-bloom) | threshold, knee, anamorphic streak, tint, chromatic fringing | — |
| [VR weapon wheel](#6-vr-weapon-wheel) | a wheel per hand, worked by the hand it belongs to | — |
| [HUD stereo gating](#7-hud-stereo-gating-bug-fix) | **bug fix** — flat sessions lost the entire HUD | [`HUD_STEREO_GATING.md`](HUD_STEREO_GATING.md) |

## 1. Billboards

A quad placed in the world with its own orientation, drawn as real
depth-tested geometry — occluded by walls, sorted against sprites, and able to
be pointed at or touched. Built so an in-world interface needs neither an
actor per panel nor a HUD overlay.

```
Level.AddBillboard(pos, w, h, yaw, tilt, facing, payload, data, col, flags, lifetime)
Level.AddBillboardPersistent(...) -> handle
Level.AttachBillboard(actor, ofs, ...)      // follows an actor, dies with it
Level.AimBillboard(start, dir)  -> hit id, UV
Level.TouchBillboard(point, r)  -> hit id, UV, distance
Level.SweepBillboard(from,to,r) -> hit id, UV, fraction along the segment
```

Six payloads: `BB_PANEL`, `BB_TEXTURE`, `BB_DIGITS`, `BB_GLYPH`, `BB_RING`,
`BB_BAR`. All six draw. Also: view-locking (resolved at *render* rate, not tic
rate, which is what makes a head-locked panel not swim), per-billboard alpha,
`BBFL_NODEPTH`, `BBFL_FOLLOWANGLE`, save/load, budget and distance culling.

`TextureID.GetIndex()` was exposed for this, and the payload/facing/flag
constants are named on `LevelLocals` so callers don't invent their own copies.

### Two defects fixed 2026-08-08

**Colour was discarded — every billboard rendered white.**
`ProcessBillboard` sets `ThingColor = bb->color` (`hw_sprites.cpp:2042`), but
`DrawSprite` only applied it inside `if (cursec != nullptr)` (`:215`). A
billboard is neither an actor nor a particle (`:2010-2011`), so `cursec` was
always null, the branch never ran, and the draw state kept the white reset
from `:385`. Tier colours, meters and label/value contrast were all computed
and then thrown away, with nothing logged.

Fixed with an `else if (isBillboard)` that applies `ThingColor` directly —
deliberately *without* the sector's sprite tint or additive colour, since a
billboard is a UI primitive placed in world space rather than a thing standing
in a room. The colour a caller asks for is the colour it gets, in any sector.

**Horizontal basis was inverted — every billboard texture rendered mirrored.**
`hw_sprites.cpp:2083` used `DVector3 right(sy, -cy, 0)`, which is the viewer's
**left**. The ordinary sprite path proves it: a sprite's extent runs along
`(-V.y, V.x)` (`:1285-1308`) and the *unmirrored* branch maps `v[0] → u = UR`
with `UL=0, UR=1` (`:1247-1248`, `gametexture.cpp:340`), so that basis points
left. A billboard yaws to face the eye, so `V = -F` and `(-V.y, V.x)` reduces
to the same `(sy, -cy)` — identical geometry, therefore also left. Billboards
had inherited the sprite path's **mirror** branch.

Corrected to `right(-sy, cy, 0)`. This also fixes `BB_DIGITS`, which walks its
own pen along `right` (`:1884-1897`) and was laying multi-digit numbers out
backwards — `120` read as `021`. `bb_flipu` was a workaround for the first
symptom and could never have fixed the second, because it flips U *inside*
each quad rather than changing the direction the pen travels; with the basis
corrected its default (off) is now the right value.

`AimBillboard` and `TouchBillboard` carry their own copies of the expression
(`vmthunks.cpp:3186`, `:3271`) and were corrected in the same change — all
three must always agree or the pointer lands somewhere other than where the
panel is drawn.

### Touch, made usable — 2026-08-08

Four changes, all in service of a pointer that lands where the panel draws and
a hand that can actually press one.

**One basis, not three copies.** The defect above was a single expression
written out three times and wrong in all three. Correcting three copies is
three chances to correct only two of them, and the symptom — a row clickable
half a panel away from where it looks — stays invisible for a long time. The
expression now lives once, in `BillboardBasis` (`g_levellocals.h`), and the
renderer, the aim ray, the touch test and the sweep all call it. Agreement is
structural rather than a comment asking for it.

**Queries ignored `bb_scale` and `bb_tiltbias`.** The renderer scales a
billboard's extent by `bb_scale` and adds `bb_tiltbias` to its lean; the two
queries used the raw `bb.width`/`bb.height` and the unbiased tilt. So a player
who raised `bb_scale` to make panels readable got a bigger panel with a dead
border, and any nonzero tilt bias moved the picture out from under the pointer.
Both cvars are `CVAR_ARCHIVE`, so this shipped as "the panels feel like they
ignore me sometimes". `BillboardBasis` takes both as parameters — passed, not
read, so the header stays free of cvar dependencies — and every caller passes
the live values.

**`BBFL_NOHIT` (flag 32).** Decoration: drawn like anything else, never
returned by a query. A composed panel is not one quad but forty — every glyph
of every label, a bar's track and its fill — and the queries return the
*nearest* hit, so a panel's own face is permanently masked by the text written
on it and a pointer aimed at a row comes back holding a letter. Without a way
to say "this one is not a target" the caller has no move: it cannot map a glyph
handle to a row, and it cannot ask the engine for the second-nearest.

**`SweepBillboard(from, to, radius) -> id, UV, frac`.** Segment versus
billboard: the first face the path touches, where on it, and how far along as
a 0..1 fraction.

`TouchBillboard` asks whether a hand is in a panel *right now*, and script only
gets to ask 35 times a second. A panel's touch slab is a few map units thick
and a deliberate jab moves a controller several units per tic, so the hand can
be in front of the panel on one tic and behind it on the next without ever
being inside it. The gentle touch works and the hard one does nothing — the
failure lands on the most emphatic gesture a player can make, which is the
worst possible place for it. Script cannot sample faster, and thickening the
slab to cover the fastest hand makes a panel you cannot stand near without
pressing.

Sweeping the path also yields "the hand *arrived* this tic" directly, instead
of making every caller infer an edge from two containment samples and hope it
saw both. `radius` inflates the face into a slab and pads its edges, which is
what a fingertip is.

Deliberately **not** in the engine: debounce, cooldown, hysteresis, and which
hand did it. Those are panel policy — how many presses a held hand is worth is
a design question, not a geometric one — and they belong to whoever owns the
panel. This reports geometry.

## 2. Surface glow

Upstream glow only ever reached wall edges. This adds glow on the **flat
itself** — a floor or ceiling lit on its own face.

```
Sector.SetFlatGlowColor(pos, color)       // pos = Sector.floor | Sector.ceiling
Sector.SetFlatGlowHeight(pos, height)
Sector.SetFlatGlowFalloff(pos, falloff)
Sector.SetFlatGlowIntensity(pos, intensity)
```

Wall glow gained matching `SetGlowFalloff` / intensity controls so all four
lanes (wall bottom, wall top, ceiling, floor) can be driven identically
instead of the wall pair behaving differently from the flat pair.

## 3. Sweep

A band of light defined in **world space** that wraps floor, wall and ceiling
continuously as it passes — rather than being a per-surface effect that breaks
at every edge. Eight bands can be live at once.

```
Level.SetSweepOrigin(mode, origin, count)
Level.SetSweepBand(index, radius, thickness, softness, col, intensity)
```

## 4. Volumetric beam

A raymarched cone that lights the air, not just the surface it lands on, with
world-space dust motes so the beam has texture and the motes stay put as the
viewer moves.

```
Level.SetVolumetricBeam(pos, dir, col, inner, outer, length,
                        density, falloff, dust, dustScale, dustDrift)
```

`vol_beam_quality` trades grain against framerate.

## 5. Bloom

`gl_bloom_threshold` was a hardcoded constant; it is now a control. Added
`gl_bloom_knee` (soft knee, so bloom ramps instead of switching on at a hard
cutoff), an anamorphic horizontal streak, a tint, and chromatic fringing.
`gl_bloom` now defaults **on**.

## 6. VR weapon wheel

One wheel per hand, each operated by the hand it belongs to, picked with the
thumbstick — and the stick no longer walks the player while the wheel is open.
The wheel announces its selection rather than deciding game state itself, and
can leash to the wrist so it follows naturally.

The wheel's info panel asks the mod what to show, rather than the engine
guessing:

```
virtual String PlayerPawn.GetVRWheelInfo(Inventory item, int hand)
```

Panel text obeys colour escape codes instead of printing them literally.

## 7. HUD stereo gating (bug fix)

`vr_hud_mount` defaults true and is `CVAR_GLOBALCONFIG`, and the mounted-HUD
condition never checked whether a stereo mode was actually running. On a flat
desktop session the engine took the mounted branch anyway and skipped the
entire 2D layer — status bar, view border, and every mod `RenderOverlay`
handler at once — while still rendering the HUD into an offscreen VR surface
that nothing composites.

Gated on `vrmode->IsVR()`, which the same block already used for its own debug
border. Full write-up, including why it reads as a one-second delay, in
[`HUD_STEREO_GATING.md`](HUD_STEREO_GATING.md).

## Building

`auto-setup-windows-vr.cmd` locates Visual Studio's bundled CMake via
`vswhere` — CMake is generally not on PATH. Build output lands in
`build-dxr/RelWithDebInfo/`.
